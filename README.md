Connect the 4 game ai using minimax algo  
  
 Made for the following assignment question:  

Question:  
  
You are given a board consisting of 8 columns and 12 rows. At each
turn, one of the two players places his/her piece in a column. It will go into the
first free row of that column. You can imagine placing the piece at the top of the
column and having it float to the bottom.The goal of the game is to get four of
your pieces in a row (either across a row, down a column, or on a diagonal). The
first person to get four in a row wins. In traditional Connect 4, the board is 7
columns by 6 rows. We deviate from the traditional game in two ways:  
  
(a) Our board is larger (12 rows instead of 6; 8 columns instead of 7) 
   
(b) We will allow wraparound for the 4 pieces in a row. For example, if player A
has two pieces in the leftmost columns of row 2 and two pieces in the rightmost
column of row 2, then player A wins.
